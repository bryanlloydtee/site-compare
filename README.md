# Site Compare Tool
Tool you can use to compare your websites. Useful when you want to compare your CSS changes from your local or staging environment
against your live site

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Getting Started
1. Run npm install to get all the dependencies
2. Create a 'baseline' folder and a 'new' folder, this is where screenshots of your site will be stored
3. Create a 'siteList.json' file and list down the urls you want to compare (see the sampleSiteList.json file for an example)
4. Execute 'npm run captureBaseline' to execute screenshot generation of your baseline site

That's it for now! I'll continue working on this during my free time and update the README if I push anything new
